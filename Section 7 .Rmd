# Environment
```{r}
e1 <- env(
  a = FALSE,
  b = "a",
  c = 2:3,
   d = 1:3
)
e1
```
Environment object in R is like a named list, with key-value pair all over the sapce.
But be aware, the name inside the list must be unique, and all those names are not ordered: they are just labels attach to some values (or you may prefer vice versa).

```{r}
new.env() # a quick way to create a new environment
```
```{r}
e1$d <- e1
env_print(e1)
```
You notice that after the modification, the d inside e1 becomes class: env a environment, just like what we did for the `e1$d <- e1`.
Therefore, you know that the modification of a environment does not creates a copy, but modified it in place, and now the d of e1 point back to e1 itself.
```{r}
env_names(e1) # this return the name of the names.
names(e1) # so as this one

global_env()#this method calls the global environment
current_env() #this method calls the current working environment
identical(global_env(), current_env()) # this helps us compare the environemnt
```

Another feature of the environment is parent: every environment has a parent environment, except the empty environment.
When we are trying to find a name inside a environment and we failed, we will start to looking from the parent of the environment, and so on and so forth.
To assign a parent, just put a unnamed arugment when creating the environment.
If you forget to assign one, R will allocate the current environment as the parent.
```{r}
e2a <- env(d = 4, e  = 5)
e2b <- env(e2a, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

env_parent(e2a) # e2a has the environmnet, global 
env_parent(e2b) # we assign e2a as e2b's parent

e2c <- env(empty_env(), d = 4, e = 5)
e2d <- env(e2c, a= 1, b = 2, c =3)

env_parents(e2b)
env_parents(e2d)
env_parents(e2b, last = empty_env())
```
